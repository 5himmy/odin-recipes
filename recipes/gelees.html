        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups cold water, divided</li>
            <li>7 teaspoons unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons strained fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons rose water</li>
            <li>2 drops red food coloring</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>Grease an 8-inch square pan with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Place 2/3 cup water in a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin on top; let stand until softened, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 1 cup water, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil syrup, covered, for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover saucepan and attach a candy thermometer to the side; continue cooking syrup until the temperature reaches 238 degrees F (114 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in gelatin mixture carefully until completely dissolved. Mix in rose water and red food coloring.</li>
            <li>Pour syrup into the greased pan. Let stand at room temperature until gelled, about 4 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and chill, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
