    <h2>Description</h3>
        <p>This manti recipe for dumplings takes time to prepare, but I'm sure you'll agree it is worth it. Manti is a popular meal in my country. Afiyet olsun (bon appétit)!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Red Pepper Oil:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Yoghurt Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
            <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use ground lamb or other ground meat instead of beef, if you prefer.</li>
